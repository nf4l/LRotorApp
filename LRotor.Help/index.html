To use it, you must have RUMlog 	  (V5.2.2 or higher). 	  Run the script "RUMlog2LRotor_V3.2.app". It will start RUMLog and <strong>LRotor</strong>. When headings are shown in RUMlog, the "DCXCC:" and "Sta:" boxes in LRotor will be filled. 	</p>	<p>	  RUMLog uses grid locators to calculate headings, and if one is supplied for the station, headings are calculated for both the DXCC entity and the station. Sometimes when an operator is on a DxPedition, the grid locator supplied is that of his home station.	</p>	<p>      The first time <strong>LRotor</strong> starts, select the      serial connection you want to use, and the rotor. Baud rate will be 	  automatically set.When those items are set, <strong>LRotor</strong> will open 			       	 the serial connection, and the LED will turn green. You 	  may also set colors in Preferences&gt;Misc. You can also set <strong> LRotor</strong> to stay 	  on top of RUMlog itself or other windows.On subsequent startup, <strong>LRotor</strong> will remember the port, rotor, colors and where it was on your screen.     </p>    <p>      If you use LRotor as a standalone program turn your antenna by typing in the heading and clicking the "Turn" or "LP" button.      Click the "LP" (Long Path) button to turn the antenna 180<sup>o</sup> from the heading in the box. The button title toggles to "SP" to go back to short path. It's set to "LP" when the "Turn" button is clicked.    </p>		<p>      You can put the script anywhere you like and put an icon on the dock. 	  Running the script will start RUMlog and <strong>LRotor</strong>. If <strong>LRotor</strong> is not visible, click on it's icon on the dock.</p>	<p>      If you have a problem with <strong>LRotor</strong>r, contact NF4L, not DL2RUM.</p>    <hr />    <p>      For problems or suggestions, email Mike, NF4L at <a      href="mailto:nf4l@nf4l.com?subject=LRotor">nf4l@nf4l.com</a>.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LRotor</strong> was developed using ORSSerialPort, Copyright (c) 	  2011-2012 Andrew R.
